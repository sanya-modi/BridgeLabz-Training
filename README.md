## Week 6 : Java 8 Features

### Day 1 - Lambda Expressions, Method Reference & Functional Interface

*(Date: 27-Jan-2026)*

- Explored `lambda expressions` to understand functional programming concepts and concise implementation of functional interfaces in Java.
- Practiced different lambda expression syntaxes and learned how they reduce boilerplate code and improve readability.
- Understood `method references` as a cleaner alternative to lambda expressions by directly referring to existing methods.
- Studied different types of method references including static methods, instance methods, and constructor references.
- Explored defining and implementing interfaces in Java along with best practices for achieving `loose coupling` and `scalability`.
- Learned `functional interfaces` and how they contain a single abstract method to support lambda expressions.
- Studied `default` and `static` methods in interfaces to provide method implementations without breaking existing code.
- Understood `marker interfaces` and how they are used to convey metadata or behavior information to the JVM or frameworks.

### Day 2 - Stream Api & Collectors

*(Day: 28-Jan-2026)*

- Explored `intermediate stream operations` such as filter, map, flatMap, distinct, sorted, peek, limit, and skip to transform and process data in a pipeline.
- Studied `terminal operations` including collect, forEach, reduce, count, anyMatch, allMatch, and noneMatch to produce final results from streams.
- Understood the difference between `stateless` and `stateful operations`, where filter is stateless while sorted and distinct are stateful operations.
- Learned about `ordered` vs `unordered` streams and how element order impacts processing and performance.
- Studied `parallel streams` and how they enable parallel processing to improve performance on large datasets.
- Compared `forEach()` in Iterable vs Stream, understanding execution order and behavior differences, especially with parallel streams.
- Learned about `Collectors` and their roles and capabilities in transforming stream elements into collections, summaries, and aggregated results.

### Day 3 – Java 8 Scenario-Based Questions Practice
*(Date: 29-30 Jan 2026)*

- Practised a wide range of scenario-based problems using Java 8 features to understand how functional programming concepts are applied in real-world applications.
- The focus was on writing clean, readable, and efficient code while replacing traditional imperative logic with modern Java constructs.

### Topics Practised in Detail

- `Lambda Expressions` - Used to simplify anonymous classes and concisely implement behaviour-driven logic.
- `Functional Interfaces` - Practised built-in interfaces such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier to model business rules.
- `Streams API` - Solved problems involving filtering, mapping, grouping, sorting, and aggregation of collections.
- `Optional Class` - Handled null-sensitive scenarios safely and avoided NullPointerException using Optional-based design.
