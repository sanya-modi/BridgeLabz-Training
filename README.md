### Day 2 - Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hashing Functions

*(Date: 03-Jan-2026)*

- Learned the concept of stack and its working based on the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- Studied queue and its working based on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- Practiced basic stack and queue operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Learned the concept of hashing and how a hashing function works.
- Studied HashMap in Java and how it stores data using key–value pairs for fast access.
