## Week 6 : Java 8 Features

### Day 1 - Lambda Expressions, Method Reference & Functional Interface

*(Date: 27-Jan-2026)*

- Explored `lambda expressions` to understand functional programming concepts and concise implementation of functional interfaces in Java.
- Practiced different lambda expression syntaxes and learned how they reduce boilerplate code and improve readability.
- Understood `method references` as a cleaner alternative to lambda expressions by directly referring to existing methods.
- Studied different types of method references including static methods, instance methods, and constructor references.
- Explored defining and implementing interfaces in Java along with best practices for achieving `loose coupling` and `scalability`.
- Learned `functional interfaces` and how they contain a single abstract method to support lambda expressions.
- Studied `default` and `static` methods in interfaces to provide method implementations without breaking existing code.
- Understood `marker interfaces` and how they are used to convey metadata or behavior information to the JVM or frameworks.
